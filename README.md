**Problem Description:**

The Director of Sterling contacted me because they are interested in leveraging the power of their data to gain insights into the business and improve their
efficiency. Sterling wants to better understand their customers' needs, preferences, and behavior. Specifically, they want to identify any patterns or trends. 
Sterling believes that leveraging the power of data can help them make more informed decisions and boost effectiveness. They want to understand their data, so they can optimize their
product offerings, streamline operations, and enhance Sterlingâ€™s customer experience.
